            <h1>Why You Should Use UNIX</h1>
            <h2>A System of Endless Possibilities</h2>
            <p> UNIX is an integral system to our everday living,
                and I can guarantee that you use it everday without
                even noticing. UNIX can be described as the backbone
                of the internet and various other amenitys you probably 
                use like Netflix and chat services. It is also the way that
                most web hosting is completed due to its capability of being
                able to have multiple people on a system at once. It also is
                the foundation for most of bioinformatics, allows the user to 
                not use non graphical user interface tools, and has a much greater
                chance of reproducibility. Most beginners and veterans of UNIX love
                it because of its variety of tasks it can preform, its multi-tasking
                capabilities, ease of use, and its importance to our everday life.
